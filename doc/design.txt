Define interface that abstracts a backend
(This is for internal use, not for clients of the library)

interface Queryable {
  String getDB()
  WorkingSet query(String query)
}

Client interface is as in D4.2

Use GUIDs for Ids


Desugarings

- path navigation to where clauses
- opposites
- implicit column/field ref to explicit entity.field


Notes to typhonML

- identifer
- how to distinguish multiple instances of the same db?
  (this is needed, because I need to partition even though both dbs are relational, but on different nodes.)
- the db types should be concrete: i.e. mongodb, not document.
