Define interface that abstracts a backend
(This is for internal use, not for clients of the library)

interface Queryable {
  String getDB()
  WorkingSet query(String query)
}

Client interface is as in D4.2

Use GUIDs for Ids


Desugarings

- path navigation to where clauses
- opposites
- implicit column/field ref to explicit entity.field
