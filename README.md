# Run in eclipse
- Import the `typhonql` as maven projects in eclipse. Let eclipse install the right maven connector plugins.

# Building with maven (for example update sites)

```
(cd typhonql-bundler && mvn clean install)
mvn clean package
```

Technically the bundler only has to be run on every version bump of the bundler. (which is needed for new maven dependencies)

# Documentation

The language is documented here: [TyphonQL: an Evolving User Manual](/typhonql/doc/typhonql.md).

# Feature support

In the tables below we will try to give an overview of feature support of the current master branch.

| Icon | Meaning |
|:---:|--|
| ğŸŒ‘ | not implemented |
| ğŸŒ’ | initial implementation, expect bugs |
| ğŸŒ“ | partially implemented (for example not on all backends) |
| ğŸŒ” | fully implemented, might be some bugs left |
| ğŸŒ• | finished |

## Types

Basic primitive types.

| Feature | Syntax | Backend | Remarks |
|----|:---:|:---:|---|
| `int` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |
| `bigint` | ğŸŒ“ | ğŸŒ“ | |
| `string[maxSize]` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• |  |
| `text` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• |  |
| `point` | ğŸŒ”  | ğŸŒ’ | operations are not yet implemented |
| `polygon` | ğŸŒ”  | ğŸŒ’ | operations are not yet implemented |
| `bool` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |
| `float` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | |
| `blob` | ğŸŒ‘ | ğŸŒ‘ | We have to decide on a syntax for blobs |
| `freetext[Id+]` | ğŸŒ” | ğŸŒ‘ | Syntax is almost finished, still requiring some work with ML & NLP teams |
| `date` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ“ | |
| `datetime` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ“ | |
| Custom data types | ğŸŒ” | ğŸŒ’ | |

## Relations

TODO: make table about different kind of relations in relation to cross database operations

The cardinalities here represent the way they are specified in TyphonML; 
so "one-zero/many" between entities A and B means "A is related to one B, and B is related to zero or many As" 
(so it does *not* mean "One A is related to many Bs").

### Containment


| Cardinality | Support |
| -----------|---------|
| one-one   | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one-zero/one |  mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one-zero/many | -- |
| one-one/many | -- |
| one/zero-one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one/zero-zero/one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one/zero-zero/many | -- |
| one/zero-one/many | -- |
| zero/many-one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| zero/many-zero/one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| zero/many-zero/many | -- |
| zero/many-one/many | -- |
| one/many-one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one/many-zero/one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one/many-zero/many | -- |
| one/many-one/many | -- |




## Expressions

| Feature | Syntax | Backend | Remarks |
|----|:---:|:---:|---|
| "nested" field access (`a.b.c`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | |
| placeholders (`??<name>`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | |
| lists (`[..]`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | only usable for relations |
| positive `+` & negative `-` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | if backends supports it |
| math operations (`*+/-`) | ğŸŒ• | ? | TODO: check support |
| comparisons  (`==` and friends) | ğŸŒ• | ? | TODO: check support|
| boolean operations (`&&` and `\|\|`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | |
| containment `x in y` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ“ | currently doesn't work from the inverse side |
| text compare `x like y` | ğŸŒ• | ? | TODO: check support |

## Backends

| Backend | Support | Remarks |
| --- | :--: | --- |
| MariaDB | ğŸŒ” | Currently not using indexes on important columns |
| MariaDB clusters | ğŸŒ‘ | Have to talk with DL team what the influence will be |
| MongoDB | ğŸŒ• | |
| Cassandra | ğŸŒ‘ | |
| Neo4J | ğŸŒ‘ | |

## Generic features

| Feature | Support | Remarks |
| --- | :--: | --- |
| Query across different backends | ğŸŒ” | |
| Query validation | ğŸŒ” | Syntax is validated and checked against the ML model |
| Query type checking in IDE | ğŸŒ“ | |
| Query optimization | ğŸŒ’ | We try to get where clauses on the correct backend |
| Unicode Support | ğŸŒ” | It should be possible to use unicode anywhere. Collation is currently fixed to utf8 (we have to think about extending this in ML if needed) |
| DAL/Generated API | ğŸŒ‘ | |
| Navigation based queries (path, reachability, transitive closure) | ğŸŒ‘ | |
| Transactions | ğŸŒ‘ | unclear if we can add decent support for this |
| Parametrized/Bulk queries | ğŸŒ“ | Currently doesn't provide a lot of performance benefit, but can in the future |
| DDL Operations | ğŸŒ“ | |
| Operations on `freetext` attributes | ğŸŒ‘ | Working with NLP team to get this integrated |
