# Run in eclipse
- Import the `typhonql` as maven projects in eclipse. Let eclipse install the right maven connector plugins.

# Building with maven (for example update sites)

```
(cd typhonql-bundler && mvn clean install)
mvn clean package
```

Technically the bundler only has to be run on every version bump of the bundler. (which is needed for new maven dependencies)

# Documentation

The language is documented here: [TyphonQL: an Evolving User Manual](/typhonql/doc/typhonql.md).

# Feature support

In the tables below we will try to give an overview of feature support of the current master branch.

| Icon | Meaning |
|:---:|--|
| ğŸŒ‘ | not implemented |
| ğŸŒ’ | initial implementation, expect bugs |
| ğŸŒ“ | partially implemented (for example not on all backends) |
| ğŸŒ” | fully implemented, might be some bugs left |
| ğŸŒ• | finished |

## Types

Basic primitive types.

| Feature | Syntax | Backend | Remarks |
|----|:---:|:---:|---|
| `int` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |
| `bigint` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |
| `string[maxSize]` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• |  |
| `text` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• |  |
| `point` | ğŸŒ•  | ğŸŒ“ | not supported on neo4j yet |
| `polygon` | ğŸŒ•  | ğŸŒ“ | not supported on neo4j yet |
| `bool` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |
| `float` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |
| `blob` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | Only supported on mongo & mariadb backends |
| `freetext[Id+]` | ğŸŒ” | ğŸŒ‘ | Syntax is almost finished, still requiring some work with ML & NLP teams |
| `date` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |
| `datetime` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |
| Custom data types | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ• | |

## Relations

TyphonML supports relationships between entities. This section briefly summarizes TyphonQL's support for them.
Note that, currently, this only involves MongoDB and SQL, since key-value stores are only used to store (primitive) properties. However, if an owning entity is removed, the corresponding entry in the key-value store is removed as well.

TODO: describe how GraphDBs fit the picture.

The cardinalities here represent the way they are specified in TyphonML; 
so "one-zero/many" between entities A and B means "A is related to one B, and B is related to zero or many As" 
(so it does *not* mean "One A is related to zero or more Bs").

*NB* for both containment and cross references, mandatory relations (e.g. one-one, one-one/many etc.) are not enforced.

### Containment

Containment induces cascade delete, even across database boundaries, but only a single hop. Recursive containment (e.g., comments that are a reply to a comment), thus, works within a single back-end only.

The unsupported relations in the following table follow from consistency constraints on TyphonML models: containment is unidirectional, and tree-shaped (i.e. "childeren can only have a single parent").

| Cardinality | Support |
| -----------|---------|
| one-one   | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one-zero/one |  mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one-zero/many | -- |
| one-one/many | -- |
| one/zero-one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one/zero-zero/one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one/zero-zero/many | -- |
| one/zero-one/many | -- |
| zero/many-one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| zero/many-zero/one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| zero/many-zero/many | -- |
| zero/many-one/many | -- |
| one/many-one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one/many-zero/one | mongo/mongo, mongo/sql, sql/mongo |
| one/many-zero/many | -- |
| one/many-one/many | -- |

### Cross references
For cross references all combinations, with the above caveat about mandatory relations, are supported.




## Expressions

| Feature | Syntax | Backend | Remarks |
|----|:---:|:---:|---|
| "nested" field access (`a.b.c`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | |
| placeholders (`??<name>`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | |
| lists (`[..]`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | only usable for relations |
| positive `+` & negative `-` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | if backends supports it |
| math operations (`*+/-`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | if backends support it |
| comparisons  (`==` and friends) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | if backends support it|
| boolean operations (`&&` and `\|\|`) | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ” | |
| containment `x in y` | ğŸŒ• | ğŸŒ“ | currently doesn't work from the inverse side |
| text compare `x like y` | ğŸŒ• | ? | TODO: check support |

## Backends

| Backend | Support | Remarks |
| --- | :--: | --- |
| MariaDB | ğŸŒ• |  |
| MariaDB clusters | ğŸŒ• | DL makes this transparant |
| MongoDB | ğŸŒ• | |
| Cassandra | ğŸŒ• | |
| Neo4J | ğŸŒ“ | geo features need to be added |

## Generic features

| Feature | Support | Remarks |
